ChordPicker_v.0.2
(c) Samuel Hildebrand

This is a simple terminal based program that selects a random chord
(Ebm, G, Dm, etc) root of a chord ("A", "B", "C", etc.), accidental
("", "b", or "#"), "tonal modifier" ("" or "m"), roman chord number
("I", "ii", "iii", etc. or "i", "ii", "III" etc.) or item from user
input and prints it in the terminal.

If you want to run the program from a shell by entering the phrase "ChordPkr"
paste the command bellow in the bottom of your .bashrc (usually: ~/.bashrc).
